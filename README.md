## Deep Learning Eigenvalues

I have prepared a visualization that shows how the eigenvalues of a convolution layer in squeezenet1_1 changes over the course of imagenet training. At epoch 30 of the training, the learning rate was reduced by a multiplicative factor of 0.1. This substantially changes the behavior of the eigenvalues; in the first 30 epochs, the norm of the operator is increasing, after the learning rate reduction the norm starts to decrease.

The first histogram shows a 3x3 linear convolution layer that maps from 8,112 features to 32,448 features.
The second histrogram shows a a 3x3 linear convolution layer that maps from 10,816 features to 43,264 features.
